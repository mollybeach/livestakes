# livestakes Game with Provable Fairness

This is a livestakes game implementation with server-verifiable, deterministic, provably fair outcomes.

## Features

- Deterministic game outcomes based on cryptographic principles
- Server-side verification of game results
- Client-side animations of the livestakes ball dropping
- Adjustable risk levels (low, medium, high)
- Different multiplier configurations based on risk level
- Configurable number of rows in the livestakes board
- Ability to change client seed and server seed for transparency
- Full verification system for game integrity

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, Matter.js (physics)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Socket.IO
- **Provable Fairness**: SHA-256 hashing, deterministic PRNG

## How Provable Fairness Works

The game uses a combination of cryptographic techniques to ensure fairness:

1. **Server Seed**: A random seed generated by the server, which is kept secret until after the game. Its SHA-256 hash is displayed to the player before the game.

2. **Client Seed**: A seed that players can view and modify. This ensures that the server cannot manipulate the outcome.

3. **Nonce**: A number that increases with each game played, preventing repetition of results.

4. **Verification**: After each game, players can verify that the outcome was determined by the combination of the server seed, client seed, and nonce.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14.x or higher
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd live-stakes
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   cd server && npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To run both the frontend and backend servers simultaneously:

```
npm run dev:all
```

Or you can run them separately:

#### Frontend
```
npm run dev
```

#### Backend
```
npm run server
```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000/livestakes and the backend will run on .

## Game Instructions

1. **Choose Game Settings**:
   - Select risk level (low, medium, high)
   - Choose number of rows (8, 12, 16)
   - Enter bet amount

2. **Play the Game**:
   - Click "Aposta" to start the game
   - Watch the ball drop through the pins
   - See your result and winnings

3. **Provable Fairness**:
   - View the server seed hash before playing
   - Change the client seed if desired
   - Verify game results using the revealed server seed after playing
